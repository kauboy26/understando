# understando
A small sandbox for you to be able to quickly implement a distributed algorithm and play around with
it. The idea is that you can see how your algorithm fares against multiple event orderings.  

This is heavily inspired by a [series of distributed labs assignments](https://github.com/emichael/dslabs)
I had to do a few years ago.
